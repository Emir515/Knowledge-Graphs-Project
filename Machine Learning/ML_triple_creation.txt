3 - ML

This folder contains queries and data exports for training embedding models.

- Inside TransE/ we have the text file containing queries_for_exporting_TransE_triples.txt
  having Cypher queries to generate a CSV file of triples:
  (head, relation, tail)

- Inside GraphSAGE/ and NNConv/ we have the similar query files for
  creating CSV exports tailored for those models.

Export instructions:
1. We run the queries in Neo4j Browser.
2. We should Export results as CSV (three dots → Export → CSV).
